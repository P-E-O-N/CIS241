					As I think back on the 10 weeks of this course I had quite a few <strong>“Ah ha”</strong> moments where something that was giving me difficulty got a bit easier.  A lot of them were <strong>SUPER</strong> basic things but as this is my very first experience with HTML I think that’s ok.  The CIW website does a pretty good job of introducing the various concepts but I don’t think it goes into them in very much depth.  That is probably a good thing because I don’t retain a lot of detailed information like that without applying it a few times first.

				<ul>
					<li>
						My first “Ah ha” moment was when I came across the <strong><a style="text-decoration:underline" onclick="window.open('https://www.w3schools.com','_blank','width=600,height=400')">www.w3schools.com</a></strong> resource.  I’ve been using that website as my foremost place to look for additional information since I discovered it.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						Another such moment was realizing that for myself I <em>REALLY</em> learn best by doing.  This is probably truer in the case of web development,  but sadly it took me a few weeks before I realized this. I needed to sit down pull up Notepad++ and explore any idea / concept that I was having trouble with.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>“Ah Ha”…</strong>  If you right click on a website the “inspect” option has a TON of information in it.  I was aware of the ability to view source, but some-how  had never just clicked on inspect and I regret that it took me so long.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						<img class="float-right" src="../images/boxmodel.png" alt="CSS Box Model" width="150"/>
						CSS box model (content / padding / border / margin) and the general idea that the basic layout of a website consists of containers within containers within containers.  I watched <strong>MANY</strong> different videos on the application of those ideas.   I feel like I understood the basics of using any given &lt;element&gt;, but the general layout was difficult.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						Another time where I felt like I was suddenly able to grasp a concept a lot more fully, was after reading this detailed description that I came across on how floats work.   The following link is an <strong><a style="text-decoration:underline" onclick="window.open('https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/floats/','_blank','width=600,height=400')">explanation of floats</a></strong> and I still find myself reading over this occasionally because I don’t understand it on an intuitive level yet.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						<img class="float-right" src="../images/cssdiner.png" alt="CSS Diner Game icon" width="100"/>
						CSS Selectors:   I wanted practice using the various selectors and came across this little game, which helped clarify them. I think I’m on level 20 something. <strong><a style="text-decoration:underline" onclick="window.open('https://flukeout.github.io/','_blank','width=600,height=400')">CSS Diner</a></strong><br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						<img style="vertical-align:top; padding-right:15px" class="float-left" src="../images/gimp.png" alt="GIMP icon" width="50"/>
						GIMP can do everything I need to do with graphics for producing my website (so far).  I hadn’t played around with GIMP before but during the creation of my site I found I needed to add transparency layers, edit the size of images, or use the transform property to orient things as desired.  I had to watch quite a few "how to" video's but GIMP is free and got the job done.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						Github only likes lowercase letters because it's Linux based.   I know this was specifically covered in the homework where we uploaded stuff to Github but it seems like it caused me grief each and every time and was always a case of lowercase vs uppercase.<br/><br/>
					</li>
					<li>
						My final “Ah ha” moment was more of a …….   <strong>“Ahhhhhhhh”</strong> moment when I realized that I was finally ready to turn in my competency demonstration.   I realize there is no end to the leaning though, so I better get used to it!<br/><br/>
